    <p>
      My name is Louis Nguyen. I am a student at Portland State University and
      am working towards a bachelors degree in computer science. Although I'm
      still exploring my specific area of interest, I am particularly drawn to
      fields like data science and game development. Like many others, I started
      by playing video games and developed a liking towards it, because of how
      fun it was it inspired me to create my own games. The experience of
      engaging with immersive worlds and quirky cool gameplay is amazing unlike
      anyting else.

      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
      Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
      1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
      make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
      also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
      unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
      sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
      publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
      Ipsum.
